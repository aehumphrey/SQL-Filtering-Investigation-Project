# SQL Filtering and Investigation Project

## Objective

The SQL Filtering and Investigation Project simulated real-world cybersecurity investigation scenarios within a large organization. The primary objective was to analyze and address potential security issues discovered in login attempts and employee records. This project involved using SQL queries and filters effectively to investigate after-hours login attempts, review specific date-related login activities, and identify and mitigate suspicious login incidents originating outside of Mexico. This project emphasizes my development of SQL proficiency alongside my critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.
